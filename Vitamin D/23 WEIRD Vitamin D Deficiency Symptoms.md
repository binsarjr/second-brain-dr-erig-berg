# SUMMARY
Dr. Berg discusses the often-overlooked symptoms associated with vitamin D deficiency. While many are aware of its connection to bone health, immune function, and mood disorders, Dr. Berg highlights 23 additional symptoms that are less commonly known. These include nightmares, restless leg syndrome, acne, bipolar disorder, skipped heartbeats, breathing disorders, skin issues, sinus problems, developmental issues in children, fatigue, early puberty, uterine fibroids, irregular menstrual cycles, urinary incontinence, vertigo, sarcopenia, myopia, glaucoma, and erectile dysfunction. He emphasizes the importance of adequate vitamin D intake and suggests supplementation and lifestyle changes to address these deficiencies.
