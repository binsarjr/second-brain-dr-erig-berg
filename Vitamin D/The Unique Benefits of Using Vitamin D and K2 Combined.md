# SUMMARY

The presentation discusses the benefits of using vitamin D3 and K2 together, focusing on resolving the calcium paradox and the French paradox. The calcium paradox involves postmenopausal women experiencing both bone loss and vascular calcification simultaneously. The French paradox involves the French consuming high amounts of saturated fat but having low rates of heart disease. The speaker explains that vitamin D3 helps absorb calcium into the blood, while vitamin K2 directs calcium to the bones and teeth, preventing calcification in arteries and other soft tissues. The presentation also covers sources of vitamin K2, its different forms (MK4 and MK7), and the recommended ratios of D3 to K2.

# IDEAS

- The calcium paradox involves postmenopausal women experiencing bone loss and vascular calcification simultaneously.
- The French paradox involves high saturated fat consumption but low heart disease rates in France.
- Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption in the intestines by 20 times.
- Vitamin K2 directs calcium from the blood into bones and teeth.
- Without vitamin K2, calcium can accumulate in arteries and other soft tissues, leading to pathological calcification.
- Vitamin K2 activates proteins that help bind calcium in bones and remove it from soft tissues.
- Hypercalcemia can be controlled with adequate vitamin K2 intake.
- Animal fats and fermented foods are primary sources of vitamin K2.
- Traditional diets had 10 times more fat-soluble vitamins, including K2, compared to modern diets.
- Vitamin K2 can improve insulin sensitivity, reducing diabetes risk.
- Vitamin K2 can help prevent varicose veins, wrinkles, cavities, and jaw malformations.
- Both vitamin D3 and K2 are needed for proper calcium mobilization.
- MK4 version of K2 is derived from animal fats but is often synthetically produced from tobacco leaves.
- MK7 version of K2 is derived from bacteria and has a longer shelf life.
- In Canada, the allowed amount of MK4 is too low to be effective.
- Recommended ratio: 100 micrograms of K2 for every 10,000 IU of D3.
- Weston Price's book "Nutrition and Physical Degeneration" discusses traditional diets rich in fat-soluble vitamins.
- Vitamin K2 was referred to as "activator X" before it was officially discovered.
- Fermented foods like cheese, sauerkraut, and natto are rich in MK7.
- Grass-fed butter, ghee, egg yolks, liver, hot dogs, and wild-caught salmon are rich in K2.

# INSIGHTS

- The combination of vitamin D3 and K2 can resolve both the calcium paradox and the French paradox by ensuring proper calcium distribution in the body.
- Vitamin K2 is crucial for preventing pathological calcification by directing calcium to bones and teeth and away from arteries and soft tissues.
- Traditional diets rich in fat-soluble vitamins like K2 contributed to better dental health and overall physical development.
- Modern dietary practices that avoid animal fats may contribute to deficiencies in essential nutrients like vitamin K2.
- The MK7 version of vitamin K2 is more effective for supplementation due to its natural origin and longer shelf life.

# QUOTES

- "A paradox is two things that sound logical but they conflict in a certain way."
- "Vitamin D3 helps the absorption of calcium in the intestines by a factor of 20x."
- "Vitamin K2 takes that calcium in the blood and transports it into the bone and the teeth."
- "K2 also activates another thing called Matrix GLA protein which removes calcium from arteries and other soft tissues."
- "Traditional diets had 10 times the amount of fat-soluble vitamins."
- "Vitamin K2 can help make insulin more sensitive to decrease someone's risk for diabetes."
- "Vitamin K2 also needs vitamin D3 to help mobilize this calcium."
- "The MK7 version has a much longer shelf life."
- "In Canada, the allowed amounts of MK4 are so tiny it's not going to even make a dent into what you really need."
- "For every 10,000 IU of D3, I would recommend 100 micrograms of vitamin K2."

# HABITS

- Consuming foods rich in vitamin K2 such as grass-fed butter, ghee, egg yolks, liver, hot dogs, and wild-caught salmon.
- Including fermented foods like cheese, sauerkraut, and natto in the diet for MK7.
- Ensuring a balanced intake of vitamin D3 and K2 to optimize calcium distribution in the body.

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY

Combining vitamin D3 with K2 ensures proper calcium distribution, preventing calcification in arteries while strengthening bones.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

- Consume foods rich in vitamin K2 such as grass-fed butter, ghee, egg yolks, liver, hot dogs, and wild-caught salmon.
- Include fermented foods like cheese, sauerkraut, and natto in your diet for MK7.
- Ensure a balanced intake of vitamin D3 and K2 to optimize calcium distribution in the body.
- Follow a traditional diet rich in fat-soluble vitamins for better dental health and overall physical development.
