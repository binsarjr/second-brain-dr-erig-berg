# SUMMARY
The content is a guide on how to make your own vitamin D supplements using mushrooms. The presenter explains that mushrooms typically have low levels of vitamin D unless exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) light. By exposing mushrooms like oyster, shiitake, maitake, or button mushrooms to UVB light, you can significantly boost their vitamin D levels. The process involves laying the mushrooms out in the sun or under a UVB light for two days. The presenter also discusses the nutritional benefits of mushrooms and provides tips for maximizing vitamin D absorption.

# IDEAS:
- Mushrooms grown in the dark have very low levels of vitamin D.
- Exposing mushrooms to UVB light can boost their vitamin D levels significantly.
- Vitamin D levels in mushrooms can reach up to 46,000 IU with proper exposure.
- Different types of mushrooms like oyster, shiitake, maitake, and button can be used.
- Exposing the gills of mushrooms maximizes vitamin D conversion.
- Button mushrooms need to be sliced lengthwise to expose more surface area.
- Vitamin D2 in mushrooms is less bioavailable and has a shorter half-life than vitamin D3.
- Consuming mushrooms with fat increases vitamin D absorption.
- Mushrooms are rich in B vitamins, selenium, zinc, copper, vitamin C complex, and potassium.
- Mushrooms are low in net carbs, making them suitable for keto diets.
- UVB light is more abundant in summer months; a UV light can be used in winter.
- Mushrooms should be laid out on a cookie sheet with gills facing up for maximum exposure.
- Stems of mushrooms do not contribute much to vitamin D levels.
- Mushrooms should be sun-dried for two days for optimal vitamin D levels.
- Over-drying mushrooms beyond two days reduces vitamin D levels.
- A glass jar with rice at the bottom helps preserve dried mushrooms by absorbing moisture.
- Fresh mushrooms exposed to the sun for 15 to 120 minutes can also increase vitamin D levels.
- UVB exposure for 18 hours can boost vitamin D2 levels to over 200,000 IU.
- A cup of shiitake mushrooms can provide up to 46,000 IU of vitamin D2.
- Button mushrooms exposed to UVB light can provide about 20,000 IU of vitamin D2.
- The process can be done at home using either sunlight or a UVB light source.

# INSIGHTS:
- Exposing mushrooms to UVB light is a simple yet effective way to significantly boost their vitamin D levels.
- The type of mushroom and the method of exposure (gills up or sliced) play crucial roles in maximizing vitamin D conversion.
- Vitamin D2 from mushrooms, although less bioavailable than D3, can still provide substantial health benefits when consumed with fat.
- The process of sun-drying mushrooms not only boosts their vitamin D levels but also preserves them for up to a year.
- Using a UV light during winter months allows for year-round production of high-vitamin D mushrooms.

# QUOTES:
- "Mushrooms have very insignificant amounts of vitamin D unless you expose that mushroom to ultraviolet B light."
- "You can boost the vitamin D in mushrooms to levels of 5,000 international units to 46,000 international units and beyond."
- "If you expose the gills, the little ridges underneath the cap, you get the maximum conversion to vitamin D."
- "Vitamin D absorption is increased when you add a fat since vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin."
- "Mushrooms have some pretty good nutrients: B vitamins, selenium, zinc, copper, vitamin C complex, and potassium."
- "They're great on keto because they're low net carb."
- "A hundred grams of shiitake mushrooms can give you up to 46,000 IUs of vitamin D2."
- "Using a light that has UVB radiation and exposing shiitake mushrooms for 18 hours could potentially boost the vitamin D2 to well over 200,000 IUs."
- "Fresh mushrooms exposed to the sun for between 15 and 120 minutes can get levels between 600 IUs to up to 5,000 IUs."
- "The whole point and the whole concept of this is to expose mushroom to the sun or some light that has UVB radiation."

# HABITS:
- Exposing mushrooms to UVB light for two days to boost their vitamin D levels.
- Consuming mushrooms with fat to increase vitamin D absorption.
- Using a glass jar with rice at the bottom to preserve dried mushrooms by absorbing moisture.
- Slicing button mushrooms lengthwise to expose more surface area for UVB exposure.
- Sun-drying mushrooms between 10 AM and 6 PM for optimal UVB exposure.

# FACTS:
- Mushrooms grown in the dark have very low levels of vitamin D.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use oyster, shiitake, maitake, or button mushrooms for best results.
- Expose the gills of mushrooms to maximize vitamin D conversion.
- Slice button mushrooms lengthwise to expose more surface area.
- Consume mushrooms with fat like butter for better vitamin D absorption.
