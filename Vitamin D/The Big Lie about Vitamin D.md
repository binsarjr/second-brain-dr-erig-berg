# SUMMARY

The speaker discusses the concept of vitamin D toxicity, arguing that what is often perceived as toxicity is actually a deficiency in co-factors such as magnesium and vitamin K2. They highlight the importance of these co-factors in preventing symptoms like irritability, insomnia, and muscle cramps. The speaker also critiques the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for vitamin D, suggesting they are too low compared to the amounts naturally obtained from sunlight. They reference studies and protocols that use high doses of vitamin D to treat autoimmune conditions and other health issues, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that includes other essential nutrients.

# IDEAS

- Vitamin D toxicity symptoms may actually be due to deficiencies in magnesium and vitamin K2.
- Most people are deficient in magnesium, which can exacerbate symptoms when taking high doses of vitamin D.
- Symptoms like irritability, insomnia, constipation, fatigue, muscle spasms, and arrhythmia can be linked to low magnesium and vitamin K2.
- Many studies on vitamin D toxicity do not account for the intake of magnesium or K2.
- Hypercalcemia, or too much calcium in the blood, is a symptom of vitamin D toxicity.
- Vitamin K2 helps prevent calcium buildup in soft tissues by directing it from the blood into the tissues.
- Magnesium is an effective antidote to prevent kidney stones.
- The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is significantly lower than what one can obtain from sunlight.
- Lifeguards in Israel had a 20 times increased risk of kidney stones due to high vitamin D levels and low K2 or magnesium.
- High doses of vitamin D (up to 200,000 IUs) have been used successfully to treat autoimmune conditions.
- The parathyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating calcium and vitamin D levels.
- Blood tests for vitamin D do not measure its effectiveness at the receptor level.
- There is no universally agreed-upon "normal" amount of vitamin D in the blood.
- Older individuals produce significantly less vitamin D from sunlight compared to younger individuals.
- Co-factors like boron, zinc, and vitamin A are also important when taking vitamin D.
- High doses of vitamin D can penetrate resistance at the receptor level in autoimmune diseases.
- The medical community often attacks unconventional views on high-dose vitamin D therapy.
- Vitamin D is hard to obtain naturally, especially for older adults.
- Therapeutic benefits of vitamin D include improved eye health and remission of autoimmune diseases.
- The speaker references Dr. Harold Shey's work on using high doses of vitamin D for eye health.

# INSIGHTS

- Vitamin D toxicity is likely a misdiagnosis; the real issue is often a deficiency in essential co-factors like magnesium and vitamin K2.
- The current RDAs for vitamin D are insufficient compared to natural sunlight exposure, leading to widespread deficiencies.
- High doses of vitamin D can be therapeutic for autoimmune conditions but must be balanced with other nutrients to avoid adverse effects.
- Blood tests for vitamin D levels are not fully indicative of its effectiveness at the cellular level, complicating diagnosis and treatment.
- Older adults face a significant challenge in maintaining adequate vitamin D levels due to reduced skin synthesis.

# QUOTES

- "I'm actually convinced that there's no such thing as a true vitamin D toxicity problem."
- "The actual cause of those symptoms I don't believe is coming from high doses of vitamin D3."
- "Most people are deficient in magnesium going into this."
- "Symptoms of low magnesium as well as symptoms of low vitamin K2."
- "You don't normally see they're taking magnesium with it; they're not taking K2 with it."
- "Vitamin K2 is needed to prevent the calcium from building up in the soft tissues."
- "Magnesium is one of the best antidotes to prevent kidney stones."
- "The amount that's recommended by the male clinic is like 600 IUS; this is ridiculous."
- "When you're out in the sun for about 30 minutes maybe 40 minutes you're going to get at least 20,000 IUS of vitamin D3."
- "There was a 20 times increased risk of getting kidney stones probably because they got a lot of vitamin D and they didn't have enough K2 or magnesium."
- "Dr. Comra from Brazil has an amazing protocol with thousands of success stories."
- "He uses between 50,000 to 100,000 to up to 200,000 IUS of vitamin D3 to put these autoimmune cases in remission."
- "The parathyroid gland controls calcium."
- "There is no agreed-upon amount of vitamin D in the blood as a certain thing that everyone agrees on in the medical profession."
- "Anything less than 150 nanograms per milliliter will likely not work."
- "Vitamin D is just really hard to get."
- "A 70-year-old will get 75% less vitamin D because their skin is older."
- "Boron is a co-actor for vitamin D and magnesium; zinc is also another co-actor very important."
- "The danger is in the lack of the co-actors for vitamin D more than the D itself."

# HABITS

- Take magnesium supplements when consuming high doses of vitamin D.
- Include vitamin K2 in your diet or supplement regimen alongside vitamin D.
- Avoid taking calcium supplements when testing for vitamin D toxicity.
- Monitor parathyroid hormone levels to gauge calcium and vitamin D status.
- Consider high-dose vitamin D therapy under medical supervision for autoimmune conditions.
- Ensure adequate sun exposure to naturally boost vitamin D levels.
- Include boron, zinc, and vitamin A as part of a comprehensive nutrient intake plan.

# FACTS

- Vitamin K2 helps direct calcium from the blood into tissues, preventing soft tissue calcification.
- Magnesium deficiency can mimic symptoms often attributed to vitamin D toxicity.
- Lifeguards exposed to high levels of sunlight had a significantly increased risk of kidney stones due to imbalanced nutrient intake.
- The RDA for vitamin D is much lower than what can be obtained from natural sunlight exposure.
- Older adults produce significantly less vitamin D from sunlight compared to younger individuals.

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY

Vitamin D toxicity symptoms are often due to deficiencies in essential co-factors like magnesium and K2 rather than excess vitamin D itself.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

- Always take magnesium and vitamin K2 when consuming high doses of vitamin D.
- Avoid calcium supplements when testing for or treating potential vitamin D toxicity.
- Consider high-dose vitamin D therapy under medical supervision for specific health conditions like autoimmune diseases.
- Ensure adequate sun exposure to naturally boost your vitamin D levels.
- Include boron, zinc, and vitamin A as part of your nutrient intake plan.

# UNFAMILIAR

- **Hypercalcemia**: A condition characterized by too much calcium in the blood.
- **Parathyroid gland**: Glands located behind the thyroid that regulate calcium levels in the blood.
- **Autoimmune conditions**: Diseases where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body.
- **Nanograms per milliliter**: A unit of measurement used to quantify substances like vitamins in the blood.
