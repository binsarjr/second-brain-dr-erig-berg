# SUMMARY
Dr. Berg discusses the causes and remedies for dry eyes, emphasizing the role of vitamin A deficiency and the importance of a healthy gallbladder for proper nutrient absorption. He shares personal experiences and practical advice on dietary changes and supplements to address the issue.

# IDEAS:
- Dry eyes can be caused by a vitamin A deficiency.
- Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin found in foods like cod liver oil, butter, and egg yolk.
- Vegetables like kale and leafy greens contain pre-vitamin A, which converts to active vitamin A in the body.
- A sluggish gallbladder can prevent the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A.
- Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include dry eyes, night vision problems, dry skin, sinus issues, and sleep apnea.
- Improving diet and taking bile salts can help improve vitamin A absorption.
- Dr. Berg recommends not relying solely on supplements but also making consistent dietary changes.
- Gallbladder health is crucial for the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients.
- Bile is essential for breaking down fat-soluble vitamins from food.
- Consuming foods rich in vitamin A is more effective than taking supplements.
- Dr. Berg shares a personal story about severe dry eyes leading to a corneal injury.
- He emphasizes the importance of addressing the root cause rather than just treating symptoms with eye drops.
- Bile salts can be taken after meals to aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
- Consistent dietary improvements are necessary for long-term health benefits.
- Vitamin A deficiency can lead to various health issues beyond dry eyes.
- Dr. Berg provides a link to a gallbladder formula that includes bile salts.
- Proper nutrient absorption requires both a healthy diet and a functioning gallbladder.
- Fat-soluble vitamins need bile for proper digestion and absorption.
- Addressing gallbladder issues can improve overall nutrient absorption and health.
- Dr. Berg advises against living off pills and stresses the importance of diet.

# INSIGHTS:
- Vitamin A deficiency is a common but often overlooked cause of dry eyes and other health issues.
- The health of the gallbladder plays a critical role in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A.
- Dietary sources of vitamin A are more effective than supplements due to better bioavailability.
- Addressing underlying health issues, such as gallbladder function, is essential for resolving nutrient deficiencies.
- Consistent dietary changes are necessary for long-term health improvements, rather than relying on quick fixes like supplements or medications.

# QUOTES:
- "Dry eyes is a vitamin A deficiency."
- "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin."
- "You can't break down the fat-soluble nutrients from the food so you never get the vitamin A."
- "The vision at night is a problem, dry skin, sinus issue, sleep apnea, and dry eyes."
- "You just can't live off a pill."

# HABITS:
- Consuming foods rich in vitamin A such as cod liver oil, butter, and egg yolk.
- Including leafy greens like kale in the diet for pre-vitamin A.
- Taking bile salts after meals to aid in nutrient absorption.
- Making consistent dietary improvements for long-term health benefits.

# FACTS:
- Vitamin A is essential for eye health and preventing dry eyes.
- Bile is necessary for the digestion and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
- Gallbladder health affects the body's ability to absorb fat-soluble nutrients.
- Vitamin A deficiency can lead to night vision problems, dry skin, sinus issues, and sleep apnea.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consume foods rich in vitamin A such as cod liver oil, butter, and egg yolk.
- Include leafy greens like kale in your diet for pre-vitamin A.
- Take bile salts after meals to aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
- Make consistent dietary improvements for long-term health benefits.
- Focus on addressing underlying health issues like gallbladder function rather than relying solely on supplements or medications.

# UNFAMILIAR:
- **Cornea**: The transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber.
- **Gallbladder**: A small organ that stores bile produced by the liver, aiding in the digestion of fats.
- **Bile**: A digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder that helps break down fats.
- **Fat-soluble vitamins**: Vitamins that dissolve in fats and oils, including vitamins A, D, E, and K.
- **Bioavailability**: The degree to which a nutrient or medication can be absorbed and used by the body.
