# SUMMARY

The content discusses the relationship between vitamin A and dry eyes, emphasizing the importance of vitamin A in maintaining the health of tear-producing glands and ducts. It highlights the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, such as dry eyes, night blindness, and blurred vision. The speaker advises against using synthetic vitamin A supplements due to potential side effects and instead recommends consuming foods rich in natural vitamin A, such as cod liver oil, liver, fatty fish, butter, ghee, cheese, egg yolks, and beef. The content also explains the difference between pre-vitamin A (beta-carotene) and active vitamin A (retinol), noting that the conversion from beta-carotene to retinol is inefficient and can be hindered by genetic factors. Additionally, it addresses other potential causes of dry eyes, such as gut inflammation, liver issues, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

# IDEAS

- Vitamin A is crucial for the health of tear-producing glands and ducts.
- Dry eyes can be a symptom of vitamin A deficiency.
- Night blindness and blurred vision are also symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.
- Many children in certain countries go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.
- Vitamin A is essential for the immune system and mucous membranes.
- Synthetic vitamin A supplements can have side effects.
- Cod liver oil is a top source of natural vitamin A.
- Liver, fatty fish, butter, ghee, cheese, egg yolks, and beef are rich in vitamin A.
- Beta-carotene and other carotenoids are not the same as retinol (active vitamin A).
- The conversion of beta-carotene to retinol is inefficient.
- 50% of the population has a genetic variant that hinders the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol.
- Retinol is only found in animal products.
- Vegans may struggle with dry eyes due to a lack of retinol.
- Gut inflammation can impair vitamin A absorption.
- Liver issues, such as fatty liver or an inflamed liver, can affect vitamin A storage and absorption.
- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can rob the body of nutrients.
- Bloating after eating fiber and vegetables can indicate SIBO.
- Vitamin A is stored in the liver, but fatty liver reduces storage capacity.
- The speaker offers keto consulting services for those needing help with their diet.

# INSIGHTS

- Vitamin A's role extends beyond vision; it is vital for maintaining the health of tear-producing glands and ducts.
- The inefficiency in converting beta-carotene to retinol highlights the importance of consuming direct sources of active vitamin A.
- Genetic factors can significantly impact an individual's ability to convert beta-carotene to retinol, affecting their overall vitamin A status.
- The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in certain countries underscores the need for better nutritional education and access to vitamin-rich foods.
- Liver health is closely linked to vitamin A storage and absorption, indicating that maintaining liver health is crucial for preventing deficiencies.

# QUOTES

- "Vitamin A has everything to do with controlling what those cells that line the inside of the gland."
- "If there's a vitamin A deficiency, the inner lining of the ducts as well as the gland can get thicker."
- "Dry eyes is definitely a vitamin A deficiency."
- "A lot of the vitamin A out there is synthetic and that comes with a package of side effects."
- "Cod liver oil is a top source of natural vitamin A."
- "Beta-carotene and other carotenoids are not the same as retinol."
- "50 percent of the population has a genetic variant which prevents this conversion to a certain degree."
- "Retinol is only in animal products."
- "Gut inflammation can impair vitamin A absorption."
- "Anything wrong with the liver can impair the ability to absorb vitamin A."
- "Vitamin A is stored in the liver, but as it starts to fill up with fat you lose the ability to store vitamin A."

# HABITS

- Consuming foods rich in natural vitamin A such as cod liver oil, liver, fatty fish, butter, ghee, cheese, egg yolks, and beef.
- Avoiding synthetic vitamin A supplements due to potential side effects.
- Monitoring gut health to ensure proper nutrient absorption.
- Maintaining liver health to support vitamin A storage and absorption.

# FACTS

- Vitamin A deficiency can lead to dry eyes, night blindness, and blurred vision.
- Many children in certain countries go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.
- Synthetic vitamin A supplements can have side effects.
- Beta-carotene must be converted into retinol to be effective as vitamin A.
- 50% of the population has a genetic variant that hinders this conversion.
- Retinol is only found in animal products.
- Gut inflammation and liver issues can impair vitamin A absorption.
