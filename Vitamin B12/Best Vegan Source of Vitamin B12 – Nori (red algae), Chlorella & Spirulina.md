# SUMMARY
The speaker discusses the best vegan sources of vitamin B12, focusing on nori, chlorella, and spirulina. They explain the difference between pseudo B12 (B12 analogue) and real B12, recommending chlorella as the best source due to its higher content of real B12. The speaker also mentions a quiz they created to analyze symptoms and find their root cause.

# IDEAS:
- There are three main vegan sources of B12: nori, chlorella, and spirulina.
- B12 comes in two forms: pseudo B12 (B12 analogue) and real B12.
- Pseudo B12 is similar in chemistry to real B12 but not in function.
- Consuming algae with high amounts of pseudo B12 can block the absorption of real B12.
- Nori and spirulina contain larger amounts of pseudo B12.
- Chlorella contains higher amounts of real B12 and very trace amounts of pseudo B12.
- To meet daily B12 requirements, one needs six tablets or one teaspoon of chlorella twice per day.
- The speaker advises against relying on nori or spirulina for B12 unless supplemented with extra B12.
- The speaker has created a quiz to analyze symptoms and find their root cause.

# INSIGHTS:
- Not all vegan sources of B12 are equally effective; some may even hinder B12 absorption.
- Chlorella is a superior vegan source of real B12 compared to nori and spirulina.
- Understanding the difference between pseudo B12 and real B12 is crucial for vegans to avoid deficiencies.
- Supplementation may be necessary for vegans relying on algae for their B12 intake.

# QUOTES:
- "There's two types of B12: there's a pseudo B12 and there's like real B12."
- "Pseudo means it's like a fake B12 and it's called a B12 analogue."
- "If an algae has larger amounts of pseudo B12 or B12 analogue, that is going to block that small bit of trace real B12 that's in there."
- "Unless you're consuming extra B12 from a supplement or something, I do not recommend trying to get your B12 from nori or spirulina."
- "Chlorella has much greater amounts of actual real B12 and very trace amounts of the pseudo analogue B12."
- "You would need six tablets or one teaspoon twice per day."

# HABITS:
- Consuming chlorella twice per day to meet daily B12 requirements.
- Taking supplements to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients.

# FACTS:
- Nori and spirulina contain larger amounts of pseudo B12, which can block real B12 absorption.
- Chlorella contains higher amounts of real B12 and very trace amounts of pseudo B12.
- Six tablets or one teaspoon of chlorella twice per day is needed to meet daily B12 requirements.

# REFERENCES:
- Nori (red algae)
- Chlorella
- Spirulina

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY
Chlorella is the best vegan source of real vitamin B12, requiring six tablets or one teaspoon twice daily.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid relying on nori or spirulina for vitamin B12 unless supplemented with extra B12.
- Consume chlorella twice per day to meet daily vitamin B12 requirements.
- Take a quiz to analyze symptoms and find their root cause.

# UNFAMILIAR:
- **Nori**: A type of red algae commonly used in Japanese cuisine.
- **Chlorella**: A type of green algae known for its high nutrient content.
- **Spirulina**: A type of blue-green algae often used as a dietary supplement.
- **Pseudo B12 (B12 analogue)**: A form of vitamin B12 that is similar in chemistry but not in function to real B12.
