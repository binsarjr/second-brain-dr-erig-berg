# SUMMARY
The video addresses the differences between synthetic and natural forms of Vitamin B12. The synthetic version, cyanocobalamin, is less easily absorbed and can release cyanide, which is potentially harmful. The natural form, methylcobalamin, is recommended for better absorption and safety. The speaker also discusses the importance of stomach acid and intrinsic factor in B12 absorption, potential deficiencies in vegans, and the side effects of B12 deficiency.

# IDEAS:
- Synthetic B12 is called cyanocobalamin, while the natural version is methylcobalamin.
- Cyanocobalamin is cheaper but requires multiple steps to be converted and absorbed.
- Cyanocobalamin can release cyanide, a toxic substance, into the body.
- Small amounts of cyanide are claimed to be non-toxic unless you are a smoker or work in certain professions.
- Historical examples show that substances once considered safe were later found to be harmful.
- Methylcobalamin is bound to a protein and requires stomach acid for absorption.
- Vegans may struggle to get enough B12 from their diet.
- Intrinsic factor in the stomach helps transport B12 to the small intestine for absorption.
- Atrophic gastritis, an autoimmune disease, can hinder B12 absorption.
- Stomach surgeries like gastric bypass can affect B12 absorption.
- Metformin, a common diabetes medication, can cause B12 deficiency.
- Wheatgrass juice powder can be a source of B12 for vegans.
- Symptoms of B12 deficiency include diarrhea, nausea, upset stomach, itchy rash, headaches, dizziness, joint pain, and fatigue.
- B12 is crucial for red blood cell production, brain function, nerve function, and DNA creation.
- Standard Process makes a product called Zypan that contains intrinsic factor to aid B12 absorption.

# INSIGHTS:
- The synthetic form of B12, cyanocobalamin, poses potential health risks due to its cyanide content.
- Historical precedents suggest caution with substances deemed safe by authorities.
- Proper stomach acid levels and intrinsic factor are critical for effective B12 absorption.
- Vegans and individuals with certain medical conditions or surgeries are at higher risk for B12 deficiency.
- B12 plays a multifaceted role in maintaining overall health, affecting everything from red blood cells to DNA synthesis.

# QUOTES:
- "The synthetic version of B12 is called cyano Kabul Amin and the natural version is methyl cobalamin."
- "It takes four steps for it to convert into this version to then be absorbed."
- "This splits off into cyanide and you heard me correctly I said cyanide."
- "They said that trans fats weren't bad and then they found that it was bad."
- "If you're gonna take b12 methyl cobalamin is the version that I would recommend."
- "Most animal products like Meads and even liver are filled with b12 but if you're a vegan it might be difficult getting b12."
- "There's something called the intrinsic factor that's in your stomach it's a little thing that helps transport b12 into the small intestine where it's absorbed."
- "If you have a condition called atrophic gastritis it's an autoimmune disease of a certain cell that makes hydrochloric acid then you're gonna have a problem with this."
- "If you're taking metformin that can create a b12 deficiency."
- "You can get b12 from wheat grass juice powder because the microbes in there can make b12."
- "B12 involved with the production of red blood cells it's also involved in brain function and nerve function and even the creation of DNA."

# HABITS:
- Avoiding synthetic forms of vitamins when possible.
- Ensuring adequate stomach acid levels for nutrient absorption.
- Monitoring dietary intake of essential vitamins, especially for vegans.
- Being cautious about substances deemed safe by authorities until proven otherwise.

# FACTS:
- Cyanocobalamin requires four steps to be converted and absorbed by the body.
- Cyanocobalamin can release cyanide into the body.
- Historical examples show that substances once considered safe were later found harmful (e.g., trans fats, thalidomide).
- Methylcobalamin requires stomach acid for proper absorption.
- Intrinsic factor in the stomach is essential for transporting B12 to the small intestine.
- Atrophic gastritis can hinder B12 absorption due to its effect on hydrochloric acid production.
- Metformin can cause B12 deficiency.
- Wheatgrass juice powder contains microbes that produce B12.

# REFERENCES:
- Standard Process's product called Zypan.

# ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY
Choose methylcobalamin over cyanocobalamin for safer and more effective Vitamin B12 supplementation.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Opt for methylcobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin for Vitamin B12 supplementation.
- Ensure adequate stomach acid levels to aid in nutrient absorption.
- Vegans should consider alternative sources like wheatgrass juice powder for their B12 needs.
- Be cautious about substances deemed safe by authorities until proven otherwise.

# UNFAMILIAR:
- Cyanocobalamin: A synthetic form of Vitamin B12 that can release cyanide.
- Methylcobalamin: A natural form of Vitamin B12 bound to a protein for better absorption.
- Intrinsic factor: A protein in the stomach that helps transport Vitamin B12 to the small intestine.
- Atrophic gastritis: An autoimmune disease affecting cells that produce hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
