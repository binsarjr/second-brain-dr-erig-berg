# SUMMARY

The content discusses the importance of Vitamin B12, its role in the body, and the symptoms of B12 deficiency. The speaker emphasizes the necessity of natural B12 (methylcobalamin) over synthetic forms (cyanocobalamin) and explains the complex absorption process of B12, which often leads to deficiencies due to malabsorption issues. The speaker also lists foods rich in B12 and highlights the seven major symptoms of B12 deficiency: pale skin, constant fatigue, mouth problems, cognitive issues, nerve problems, blurred vision, and a fast pulse rate.

# IDEAS

- Vitamin B12 is crucial for making DNA, myelin sheath, and red blood cells.
- B12 deficiency can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system.
- There are two types of B12: natural (methylcobalamin) and synthetic (cyanocobalamin).
- Malabsorption is a common reason for B12 deficiency rather than dietary lack.
- Intrinsic factor is necessary for B12 absorption; its deficiency can lead to pernicious anemia.
- Conditions like atrophy of the stomach, lack of hydrochloric acid, gastritis, ulcers, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome can block B12 absorption.
- About 20% of people over 60 have a B12 deficiency.
- Aging reduces stomach acidity and B12 absorption.
- Supplements like betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar can help increase stomach acidity and improve B12 absorption.
- The body needs only micrograms of B12 daily.
- Many B complex products contain excessive amounts of synthetic B12.
- Animal liver, kidney, clams, seafood, sardines, beef, chicken, fish, fermented products like kimchi and sauerkraut, fermented dairy, insects, and nutritional yeast are good sources of B12.
- Vegans and vegetarians are at higher risk of B12 deficiency.
- Some nutritional yeast products contain natural B12 from bacteria.
- Pale skin can indicate a lack of red blood cells due to B12 deficiency.
- Constant fatigue and weakness are symptoms of B12 deficiency due to poor oxygen metabolism.
- Mouth ulcers and a swollen red tongue can result from insufficient oxygen in the tongue.
- Cognitive issues like depression, anxiety, memory problems, paranoia, and delusions can arise from B12 deficiency.
- Peripheral neuropathy, characterized by nerve disorders in the extremities, can occur due to lack of myelin production.
- Severe B12 deficiency can cause irreversible nerve damage and severe pain.
- Blurred vision can result from affected retinal neurological tissue due to B12 deficiency.
- A fast pulse rate may indicate the heart compensating for low oxygen levels due to insufficient red blood cells.

# INSIGHTS

- The complexity of B12 absorption means that many people may be deficient without realizing it due to underlying digestive issues.
- The elderly are particularly vulnerable to B12 deficiency because of reduced stomach acidity with age.
- Natural sources of B12 are preferable to synthetic supplements due to better bioavailability and fewer side effects.
- Cognitive and neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency highlight the vitamin's critical role in brain health and function.
- Addressing digestive health is crucial for preventing and treating B12 deficiency effectively.

# QUOTES

- "B12 is involved in making DNA, myelin sheath which is the coating around the nerves."
- "If you're deficient you can actually experience irreversible damage to your nervous system."
- "The main reason why people are deficient is not necessarily that they're not eating foods with B12; it has to do with malabsorption."
- "Intrinsic factor is necessary for B12 absorption; its deficiency can lead to pernicious anemia."
- "About 20% of everyone over the age of 60 has a B12 deficiency."
- "As we get older we lose the acidity of our stomach and also the ability to absorb B12."
- "Supplements like betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar can help increase stomach acidity and improve B12 absorption."
- "The body needs only micrograms of B12 daily."
- "Animal liver, kidney, clams, seafood, sardines, beef, chicken, fish, fermented products like kimchi and sauerkraut are good sources of B12."
- "Vegans and vegetarians are at higher risk of B12 deficiency."
- "Pale skin can indicate a lack of red blood cells due to B12 deficiency."
- "Constant fatigue and weakness are symptoms of B12 deficiency due to poor oxygen metabolism."
- "Mouth ulcers and a swollen red tongue can result from insufficient oxygen in the tongue."
- "Cognitive issues like depression, anxiety, memory problems, paranoia, and delusions can arise from B12 deficiency."
- "Peripheral neuropathy can occur due to lack of myelin production."
- "Severe B12 deficiency can cause irreversible nerve damage and severe pain."
- "Blurred vision can result from affected retinal neurological tissue due to B12 deficiency."
- "A fast pulse rate may indicate the heart compensating for low oxygen levels due to insufficient red blood cells."

# HABITS

- Taking natural methylcobalamin supplements instead of synthetic cyanocobalamin.
- Using betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to increase stomach acidity for better B12 absorption.
- Including animal liver or kidney in the diet for high natural B12 content.
- Consuming fermented products like kimchi or sauerkraut for potential natural sources of B12.
- Regularly checking for symptoms like pale skin or constant fatigue as indicators of possible B12 deficiency.

# FACTS

- Vitamin B12 is essential for making DNA, myelin sheath, and red blood cells.

- About 20% of people over 60 have a Vitamin B12 deficiency.
- The body requires only micrograms of Vitamin B12 daily.
- Many commercial B complex products contain excessive amounts of synthetic Vitamin B12.
- Natural sources of Vitamin B12 include animal liver, kidney, clams, seafood, sardines, beef, chicken, fish, fermented products like kimchi and sauerkraut, fermented dairy products like cheese, insects, and nutritional yeast.
