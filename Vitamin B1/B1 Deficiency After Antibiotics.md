# SUMMARY

The video discusses the relationship between B1 (thiamine) deficiency and the use of antibiotics. The presenter explains how certain antibiotics can lead to a deficiency in B1 by killing off beneficial microbes that produce this vitamin. Symptoms of B1 deficiency include anxiety, agitation, nervousness, memory issues, severe hypoglycemia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture. The presenter emphasizes the importance of taking probiotics and B vitamins, particularly nutritional yeast, when on antibiotics to mitigate these deficiencies.

# IDEAS

- Antibiotics can cause B1 (thiamine) deficiency by killing off beneficial microbes that produce this vitamin.
- Over 60 generic versions of antibiotics can lead to B1 deficiency.
- Symptoms of B1 deficiency include anxiety, agitation, nervousness, memory issues, severe hypoglycemia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture.
- Severe hypoglycemia from B1 deficiency can lead to coma.
- B1 is crucial for both carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.
- A deficiency in B1 can impair the transport of branched amino acids necessary for collagen formation.
- Antibiotics can cause disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, and nerves.
- Irreversible peripheral neuropathy is another risk associated with certain antibiotics.
- Taking probiotics and B vitamins, especially nutritional yeast, is recommended when on antibiotics.
- The video aims to raise awareness about the link between antibiotics and B1 deficiency.
- The presenter offers a keto consultant service for those needing help with their keto diet.

# INSIGHTS

- Antibiotics not only kill harmful bacteria but also beneficial microbes that produce essential vitamins like B1.
- The metabolic role of B1 extends beyond carbohydrates to include amino acids, highlighting its broader importance in bodily functions.
- The potential for severe side effects like tendon rupture and irreversible neuropathy underscores the need for caution when using antibiotics.
- Proactive supplementation with probiotics and B vitamins can mitigate some of the negative impacts of antibiotics on nutrient levels.
- Awareness of nutrient deficiencies caused by medications can lead to better health outcomes through preventive measures.

# QUOTES

- "Vitamin B1 comes from your diet but it also comes from your microbes."
- "As you kill them off with taking an antibiotic, you can end up with a B1 deficiency and other deficiencies as well."
- "Symptoms include ADD, anxiety, agitation, nervousness, lack of memory, severe hypoglycemia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture."
- "Vitamin B1 doesn't just deal with carbohydrate metabolism; it deals with amino acid metabolism as well."
- "If you're deficient in B1, you're not going to be able to transport certain branch amino acids to make your collagen."
- "There are disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, and nerves."
- "It can create irreversible peripheral neuropathy."
- "I would highly recommend you not only take a probiotic at the same time but also take your B vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast."

# HABITS

- Taking probiotics when on antibiotics to maintain gut health.
- Supplementing with B vitamins, particularly nutritional yeast, during antibiotic treatment.
- Consulting a keto expert for personalized advice on diet management.
