# SUMMARY
The speaker discusses seven unusual symptoms of Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. These symptoms include Raynaud's phenomena, morning sickness, increased pulse rate, edema, psychosis, shortness of breath, and dizziness upon standing. The speaker emphasizes the importance of B1 and suggests taking nutritional yeast to address these deficiencies. Additionally, the speaker offers resources for those interested in the keto diet.

# IDEAS:
- Raynaud's phenomena, where fingertips turn blue in cold, can be caused by a B1 deficiency.
- B1 deficiency affects the autonomic nervous system, impairing its ability to adapt to stress and temperature changes.
- Morning sickness and hypersensitivity to odors during pregnancy can be linked to a lack of B1.
- An increased pulse rate or heart rate may indicate a B1 deficiency.
- Edema or swelling in the ankles can be a symptom of subclinical beriberi, specifically wet beriberi affecting the cardiovascular system.
- Psychosis, characterized by a disconnection from reality, can be related to a B1 deficiency.
- Shortness of breath or air hunger, especially at night, may be due to insufficient B1.
- Dizziness when moving from a seated or lying position to standing can be a sign of B1 deficiency.
- Nutritional yeast is recommended as a source of B1.
- The autonomic nervous system's failure to adapt to gravity stress can cause dizziness upon standing.
- B1 deficiency can lead to both wet beriberi (cardiovascular issues) and dry beriberi (nervous system issues).
- The speaker provides links for more information about B1.
- A keto consultant is available for those needing help with the keto diet in the US.

# INSIGHTS:
- Vitamin B1 is crucial for the proper functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which helps the body adapt to various stresses.
- Unusual symptoms like Raynaud's phenomena and morning sickness can be early indicators of a B1 deficiency.
- Both cardiovascular and nervous system issues can arise from different types of beriberi caused by B1 deficiency.
- Addressing B1 deficiency through dietary sources like nutritional yeast can alleviate a range of symptoms from psychosis to edema.

# QUOTES:
- "Raynaud's phenomena is a situation where your fingertips turn literally blue when you actually get exposed to cold."
- "Morning sickness and hypersensitivity to certain types of odors during pregnancy are linked to a B1 deficiency."
- "Increased pulse rate or heart rate is a B1 deficiency."
- "Edema or swelling in the ankles could be a B1 deficiency because of subclinical beriberi."
- "Psychosis could be a B1 deficiency."
- "Shortness of breath or air hunger, especially at night, is a B1 deficiency."
- "Dizziness from going from a seated position or lying down to standing up is a B1 deficiency."
- "If you have any of these odd symptoms, you need to be taking nutritional yeast."

# HABITS:
- Taking nutritional yeast as a source of Vitamin B1.
- Monitoring unusual symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath as potential signs of nutrient deficiencies.
- Consulting with a keto diet expert if experiencing difficulties with the diet.

# FACTS:
- Raynaud's phenomena involves fingertips turning blue due to cold exposure and can be linked to B1 deficiency.
- Morning sickness and sensitivity to odors during pregnancy may indicate a lack of B1.
- Increased heart rate and edema are potential symptoms of subclinical beriberi caused by B1 deficiency.
- Psychosis and shortness of breath can also be related to insufficient B1 levels.
- Dizziness upon standing is another symptom that may indicate a need for more B1.
