# SUMMARY
The content discusses the symptoms, causes, and remedies for a B3 (niacin) deficiency. It highlights both major and subclinical symptoms, the importance of niacin for various bodily functions, and how to correct deficiencies. The speaker also touches on the role of niacin in energy production, skin health, and mental health, and provides dietary sources of niacin.

# IDEAS:
- B3 deficiency can lead to the "4 Ds": dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death.
- Subclinical symptoms of B3 deficiency include loss of taste, metallic or rancid taste in the mouth, loss of smell, and visual distortions.
- Fatigue and an inability to relax can also be signs of a subclinical B3 deficiency.
- Major B3 deficiency is known as pellagra.
- Correcting a B3 deficiency often requires more than the standard RDA; large amounts like 6 grams per day may be necessary.
- Niacin is crucial for mitochondrial function and energy extraction from food.
- NAD, derived from niacin, is essential for longevity and DNA repair.
- Aging reduces NAD levels, contributing to degenerative diseases.
- Tryptophan can convert into niacin, serotonin, and melatonin.
- Niacin is vital for skin health, helping with conditions like acne and psoriasis.
- Niacinamide, a form of B3, is beneficial for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
- Niacin helps manage cholesterol levels and was popular before statins were developed.
- High levels of B3 are found in animal products, especially red meat and liver.
- Nutritional yeast and spirulina are good non-animal sources of B3.
- Processed foods can lead to a B3 deficiency.
- Pregnancy, alcoholism, COVID-19, and certain medications increase the demand for B3.
- Flushing from niacin is not dangerous and can be managed by starting with small doses.
- Niacin is used to treat fatty liver disease.
- The need for B3 increases with higher protein and carbohydrate intake.

# INSIGHTS:
- Subclinical B3 deficiency symptoms can be subtle but significantly impact quality of life.
- Large doses of niacin are often required to correct deficiencies, far exceeding standard RDAs.
- Niacin's role in mitochondrial function links it directly to energy production and overall vitality.
- The decline in NAD levels with age underscores the importance of niacin in combating degenerative diseases.
- Niacin's impact on mental health conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder highlights its broader physiological importance.
- The connection between processed foods and B3 deficiency emphasizes the importance of whole foods in maintaining nutrient balance.
- Niacin's benefits for skin health extend beyond cosmetic concerns to serious conditions like psoriasis and acne.
- The body's increased demand for B3 during pregnancy, illness, or medication use suggests a need for tailored nutritional strategies in these situations.

# QUOTES:
- "You might lose this sense of taste."
- "You might have a metallic taste in your mouth or rancid taste in your mouth."
- "A loss of smell... can also be niacin."

- "The ground seems to be a little unstable or could be moving a little bit."
- "You may also have fatigue or just the feeling like you can't relax."
- "To correct these deficiencies you can't just take the normal RDAs."
- "Niacin helps you extract electrons from foods which is your energy currency."
- "Having sufficient amounts of niacin you can produce more energy from the food that you eat."
- "Niacin is involved in longevity and DNA repair."
- "Most diseases really originate from the mitochondria."
- "As you age your NAD gets less and less and less."

- "Niacin is super important for your skin."
- "Niacinamide can actually help you more with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis."
- "Niacin greatly helps your lipids cholesterol LDL HDL."
- "Processed foods can create a B3 deficiency."
- "Pregnancy being an alcoholic COVID-19 can increase the demand for B3."
- "If you're on medications a lot of medications boy your need for B3 goes way up as well."

# HABITS:
- Consuming high levels of animal products like red meat and liver for B3 intake.
- Using nutritional yeast without added synthetic vitamins as a source of B3.
- Incorporating spirulina into the diet for additional B3.
- Gradually increasing niacin intake to manage flushing effects.
- Monitoring diet to avoid processed foods that deplete B3 levels.
- Adjusting B3 intake during pregnancy or illness to meet increased demands.
